# TravelTribe

# Description
Organizing a travel group is sometimes challenging. Careful planning and open communication are the keys to success. Travel Tribe is an exclusive social media application that allows group members to meet, share ideas, and ultimately take the stress out of organizing. Post schedule updates, meeting locations and connect with your traval companions in a meaningful way, so that you can focus on enjoying your trip, rather than stressing over the details. Wherever the journey takes you, Travel Tribe has your back. Bon voyage!

User Story: As a traveler looking to connect my travel companions, I want the ability to add a trip and link my friends to the trip. I want to be able to include a description, place, departure and arrival dates, so everyone knows what to expect. I want myself and my group to be able to communicate any necessary information within a communication section specific to our trip.
